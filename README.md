## Important Notes

1. The application requires Ollama to be running on the same machine or network
2. For mobile deployment, you'll need to:
   - Either run Ollama on a server accessible to the mobile device
   - Or modify the code to use a different LLM API service

## Troubleshooting

1. If the chat doesn't respond:
   - Ensure Ollama server is running
   - Check if the model is properly installed
   - Verify your network connection

2. If the app fails to build:
   - Run `flutter clean`
   - Run `flutter pub get`
   - Try building again
